 CODSOFT - Calculator

This is my simple calculator project for the CODSOFT Web Development Internship.  
It’s made using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

 What it can do?
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
- Clear all values (C button)
- Remove last digit (← button)
- Works in any modern browser

 How to check it?
1. Download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Start using the calculator.
